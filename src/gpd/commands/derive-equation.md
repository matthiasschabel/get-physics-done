<objective>
Route a derivation request into the workflow-owned rigorous derivation flow.
Provide the equation or topic as an argument. If project context exists and the
request is omitted or ambiguous, ask one focused clarification question. Outside a project, an explicit derivation target is required and empty standalone launches stay blocked.

Keep standalone/current-workspace durable derivation artifacts under `GPD/analysis/` rooted at the invoking workspace. Only runs with authoritative phase context may additionally write sibling phase artifacts and persist project registry state.
The same-named workflow owns assumptions, conventions, algebra, physics checks,
proof-redteam handoff, artifact writing, and registry persistence.
</objective>

<context>
Target: $ARGUMENTS

Validated command-context owns optional current-workspace state detection. Use the `CONTEXT` payload plus the workflow-owned init/result lookup for any available `GPD/STATE.md` background; this wrapper must not attach raw project-file includes.
</context>

<execution_context>

## 0. Validate Context

```bash
CONTEXT=$(gpd --raw validate command-context derive-equation "$ARGUMENTS")
if [ $? -ne 0 ]; then
  echo "$CONTEXT"
  exit 1
fi
```

## 1. Execute the Derivation Workflow

Execute the included derive-equation workflow end-to-end.
Preserve canonical result lookup via `gpd result search` and direct stored-result inspection via `gpd result show "{result_id}"`. The artifact write happens inside the workflow; registry persistence only when authoritative phase context exists. Registry writes use `gpd result persist-derived`, carry forward the stable `result_id` request and actual canonical `result_id`, seed continuation from that canonical entry, and stay disabled for standalone artifacts.
</process>
