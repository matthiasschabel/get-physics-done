<objective>
Route a numerical-convergence request into the workflow-owned validation flow.

Keep standalone/current-workspace durable outputs under `GPD/analysis/` rooted at the invoking workspace. Only authoritative phase-backed runs may write phase-local reports. Standalone/current-workspace runs stop after writing the analysis artifact, do not mutate `STATE.md` or `state.json`, and do not assume a standalone commit step.
</objective>

<execution_context>
@{GPD_INSTALL_DIR}/workflows/numerical-convergence.md
</execution_context>

<context>
Target: $ARGUMENTS

Interpretation:

- If a number: test convergence for that current-workspace phase only when authoritative phase context exists
- If a file path: test convergence for computations in that file
- If empty in current-workspace project mode: ask one focused question to identify the phase or file target
- If empty outside a project: command-context validation rejects the request; require an explicit phase number or file path
- Phase-local reports are honest only when authoritative phase context exists in the current workspace. Otherwise write the durable artifact under `GPD/analysis/numerical-{slug}.md`

</context>

<process>
## 0. Validate Context

```bash
CONTEXT=$(gpd --raw validate command-context numerical-convergence "$ARGUMENTS")
if [ $? -ne 0 ]; then
  echo "$CONTEXT"
  exit 1
fi
```

Execute the included numerical-convergence workflow end-to-end.
The workflow owns target resolution, decisive checks, report content, and the
phase-backed vs standalone/current-workspace persistence split.

<success_criteria>

- [ ] Numerical target resolved from the explicit request or authoritative current-workspace phase context
- [ ] Convergence study design and grading recorded for each computation tested
- [ ] Output path is phase-local only when authoritative phase context exists
- [ ] Standalone/current-workspace runs write only under `GPD/analysis/` and do not mutate project state
- [ ] Final report contains enough detail to reproduce the convergence study
