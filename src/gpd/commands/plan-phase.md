<objective>
Create executable phase prompts for a research phase.
</objective>

<execution_context>
@{GPD_INSTALL_DIR}/workflows/plan-phase/phase-bootstrap.md
</execution_context>

<context>
Phase number: $ARGUMENTS (optional; auto-detects the next unplanned phase if omitted)
Canonical contract schema and hard validation rules are enforced later by the staged planner and checker handoffs; every proof-bearing plan must surface the theorem statement, named parameters, hypotheses, quantifier/domain obligations, and intended conclusion clauses visibly enough that a later audit can detect missing coverage.

**Flags:**

- `--research` -- Re-research even if `RESEARCH.md` exists
- `--skip-research` -- Skip research and plan directly
- `--gaps` -- Gap-closure mode (`VERIFICATION.md`, no research)
- `--skip-verify` -- Skip non-proof plan checker verification after planning; proof-bearing plans still require checker review or an equivalent main-context audit
- `--light` -- Produce contract-plus-constraints plans only

Normalize the phase input before any directory lookups.
</context>

<process>
Read the included bootstrap authority first. After each stage handoff, reload staged init for the next `stage_id` and read only the files listed in `staged_loading.eager_authorities`; do not load `staged_loading.must_not_eager_load`.
</process>
