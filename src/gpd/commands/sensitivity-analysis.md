<objective>
Route a sensitivity-analysis request into the workflow-owned implementation.

Keep any standalone/current-workspace durable artifacts under `GPD/analysis/` rooted at the invoking workspace. Only authoritative phase-backed project runs may persist phase-local reports or update project state; standalone/current-workspace runs stop after writing the analysis artifact and presenting the findings.
</objective>

<execution_context>
@{GPD_INSTALL_DIR}/workflows/sensitivity-analysis.md
</execution_context>

<context>
Target: $ARGUMENTS

Interpretation:

- Use `--target` to name the observable or stored result to analyze
- Use `--params` to name the parameters included in the analysis
- If `--method` is omitted, let the workflow choose analytical, numerical, or combined
- In standalone/current-workspace mode, centralized preflight requires explicit `--target` and `--params`
- Validated command-context owns optional current-workspace supporting context; the workflow re-loads needed background through its workspace-locked init step
</context>

<process>
Run centralized context preflight before executing the workflow:

```bash
CONTEXT=$(gpd --raw validate command-context sensitivity-analysis "$ARGUMENTS")
if [ $? -ne 0 ]; then
  echo "$CONTEXT"
  exit 1
fi
```

Execute the included sensitivity-analysis workflow end-to-end.
The workflow owns canonical lookup, parameter ranking, report content, and the
phase-backed vs standalone/current-workspace persistence split.
</process>

<success_criteria>

- [ ] Target quantity and parameter list resolved from the explicit request or canonical current-workspace result lookup
- [ ] Sensitivity method chosen and justified
- [ ] Parameters ranked by contribution to the output uncertainty
- [ ] Critical thresholds, stiff directions, and null directions documented
- [ ] Recommendations written for which inputs deserve more effort
- [ ] Standalone/current-workspace runs write only under `GPD/analysis/` and do not mutate project state
