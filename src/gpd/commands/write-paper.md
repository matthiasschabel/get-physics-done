  compact_description: Draft a paper from current project results or one explicit external-authoring intake manifest into the resolved manuscript lane
  display_signature: gpd:write-paper [--intake path/to/write-paper-authoring-input.json]
  examples:
    - gpd:write-paper
    - gpd:write-paper --intake intake/write-paper-authoring-input.json
  notes:
    - Uses a bounded external-authoring lane driven by an explicit intake manifest only.
    - GPD-authored outputs live under `GPD/publication/{subject_slug}/...`; `GPD/publication/{subject_slug}/intake/` stores intake/provenance state only.
    - It does not mine arbitrary folders, and embedded external staged-review parity is out of scope.
    - Project-backed review/response/package outputs remain in the resolved GPD manuscript lane.

<objective>
Structure and write a physics paper from completed research results or a bounded explicit external-authoring intake.

Keep the wrapper thin and let the workflow own the full pipeline.

**Why subagent:** Publication drafting and review coordination burn context fast.
</objective>

@{GPD_INSTALL_DIR}/workflows/write-paper/paper-bootstrap.md
</execution_context>

<context>
Project manuscript context or intake: $ARGUMENTS

Two lanes only: project-backed authoring, or bounded external authoring from
`--intake path/to/write-paper-authoring-input.json`. Validate before writing.
External authoring is fail-closed: no workspace mining, positional-folder
discovery, or `PAPER-CONFIG.json` as intake. Boundary reference:
`{GPD_INSTALL_DIR}/references/publication/publication-pipeline-modes.md`.
Project-backed manuscripts may use `GPD/publication/{subject_slug}/manuscript`;
review/response auxiliaries stay under `GPD/`. Durable external-authoring state
uses `GPD/publication/{subject_slug}/...`; `.../intake/` is provenance only.
</context>

<process>
Follow the included first-stage authority exactly. Later stage loading is
manifest-owned. The root workflow index is only a staged-file map.
</process>

<success_criteria>
- [ ] Workflow ran end to end
- [ ] Final manuscript artifacts exist on disk
- [ ] Project-backed lane: final review artifacts exist on disk when embedded staged review runs
- [ ] External-authoring lane: manuscript-root artifacts were produced and the workflow routed to standalone `gpd:peer-review`
- [ ] Theorem-bearing manuscripts retain the proof-redteam gate
</success_criteria>
