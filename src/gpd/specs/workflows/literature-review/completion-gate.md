Verify review completion and sidecar freshness before presenting results.

<process>

<step name="return_results">
Apply `references/orchestration/child-artifact-gate.md` and `references/orchestration/continuation-boundary.md` for generic typed-return, label, freshness, and continuation semantics.

```bash
COMPLETION_GATE_INIT=$(load_literature_review_stage completion_gate "${topic:-$ARGUMENTS}")
if [ $? -ne 0 ]; then
  echo "ERROR: gpd initialization failed: $COMPLETION_GATE_INIT"
  exit 1
fi
```

Use `gpd --raw stage field-access literature-review --stage completion_gate --style instruction` to confirm the manifest-selected completion fields. Read only those keys from `COMPLETION_GATE_INIT`; `COMPLETION_GATE_INIT.staged_loading.required_init_fields` is the runtime confirmation before presenting results.

Local completion gate:

- completed: `GPD/literature/{slug}-REVIEW.md` exists; `GPD/literature/{slug}-CITATION-SOURCES.json` exists and remains aligned with the review's Full Reference List; `GPD/literature/{slug}-CITATION-AUDIT.md` is current; all three paths are named in `files_written` and present/readable on disk.
- checkpoint: include the decision question, context, options, and partial progress; record the user's answer as `checkpoint_response` before continuation.
- blocked/failed: list the missing artifact, malformed artifact, stale audit, or unresolved scope issue explicitly.

Include `papers_reviewed`, `field_assessment`, and citation verification details as needed.
