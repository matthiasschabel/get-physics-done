<purpose>
Own mapper prompt assembly, parallel fanout, artifact verification, secret scan,
commit, and completion reporting after bootstrap resolves project-rooted output
paths.
</purpose>

<stage_boundary>
This authority starts only after `map_bootstrap` has routed existing maps and created or selected the project-rooted `GPD/research-map/` directory. Do not read `workflows/map-research.md`; it is only a staged-file index.
</stage_boundary>

<philosophy>
Use dedicated mapper agents for fresh per-domain context and direct writes.
Documents should be practical reference material with concrete paths, equations,
code/data formats, conventions, validation status, and open concerns. Agents
load `{GPD_INSTALL_DIR}/references/templates/research-mapper/`; missing
templates indicate a broken install.
</philosophy>

<stage_prerequisites>
If this authority is entered fresh, reuse the `load_map_research_stage` helper
from `map_bootstrap` before running `mapper_authoring` init.
</stage_prerequisites>

<process>
<step name="spawn_agents">
Spawn 4 parallel gpd-research-mapper agents.

Load the authoring slice only after existing-map routing and directory setup are complete:

```bash
MAPPER_AUTHORING_INIT=$(load_map_research_stage mapper_authoring)
if [ $? -ne 0 ]; then
  echo "ERROR: gpd initialization failed: $MAPPER_AUTHORING_INIT"
  exit 1
fi
```

Use `gpd --raw stage field-access map-research --stage mapper_authoring --style instruction` to confirm the manifest-selected authoring fields. Read only those keys from `MAPPER_AUTHORING_INIT`; `MAPPER_AUTHORING_INIT.staged_loading.required_init_fields` is the runtime confirmation. Use that refresh for mapper prompts; do not reuse bootstrap state for authoring.

Use task tool with `subagent_type="gpd-research-mapper"`, `model="{mapper_model}"`, `readonly=false`, and `run_in_background=true` for parallel execution.
@{GPD_INSTALL_DIR}/references/orchestration/runtime-delegation-note.md

> Apply the canonical runtime delegation convention already loaded above.

**CRITICAL:** Use the dedicated `gpd-research-mapper` agent, NOT `Explore`. The mapper agent writes documents directly.

Each mapper prompt must carry the staged intake, reference file handles, active reference IDs, protocol load manifest/verifier extensions, contract load/validation status, and project contract. Keep compact inline authority instructions in the task prompt; prefer contract IDs only when `project_contract_gate.authoritative` is true. Mapper agents should read selected paths with file_read when the mapping task needs source text; this stage does not embed broad reference excerpts or rendered protocol prose.

Mapper write paths are project-rooted. Resolve every relative `GPD/research-map/...` path against `{project_root}` and write to the corresponding absolute target under `{research_map_dir_absolute}`. Never write under the runtime shell cwd unless it is the same directory as `{project_root}`.

**If any mapper agent fails to spawn or returns an error:** Finish remaining agents, but missing expected documents block completion unless the user explicitly accepts a partial map; default to retrying missing mapper slices.

Continue to collect_confirmations.
</step>

<step name="collect_confirmations">
Wait for all 4 agents to complete.

Read each agent's output file for confirmation, then reconcile the typed return with on-disk artifacts.

Each agent returns typed status plus file paths/line counts, not document
contents. Accept `gpd_return.status: completed` only through the focus-specific
artifact gate.

Compact completed return anchor:

```yaml
gpd_return:
  status: completed
  files_written:
    - GPD/research-map/FORMALISM.md
    - GPD/research-map/REFERENCES.md
  issues: []
  next_actions:
    - Verify the focus-specific artifact gate before accepting completion.
  focus: theory
```

Continue to verify_output.
</step>

<step name="verify_output">
Verify all documents created successfully:

```bash
ls -la "$RESEARCH_MAP_DIR_ABS/"
wc -l "$RESEARCH_MAP_DIR_ABS"/*.md
```

**Verification checklist:**

- All 7 documents exist
- No empty documents (each should have >20 lines)

If any documents are missing or empty, stop before secret scan and commit unless the user explicitly chooses partial mode. Say `Research project mapping is partial, not complete.`, list missing docs/focus, ask `retry` or `accept partial map`, and make `gpd:map-research [missing focus]` the primary `## > Next Up`.

`retry` reruns missing focus areas. `accept partial map` sets `MAP_STATUS=partial`. Never call partial output complete or make `gpd:new-project` the primary next step. If all documents exist and are non-empty, set `MAP_STATUS=complete`.

After complete verification or explicit partial-map acceptance, continue to scan_for_secrets.
</step>

<step name="scan_for_secrets">
**CRITICAL SECURITY CHECK:** Scan output files for accidentally leaked secrets before committing.

Run secret pattern detection:

```bash
grep -E '(sk-[[:alnum:]]{20,}|sk_(live|test)_|gh[pousr]_[[:alnum:]]{20,}|glpat-|AKIA[[:alnum:]]{16}|xox[baprs]-|BEGIN .*PRIVATE KEY|eyJ[[:alnum:]_-]+\.eyJ)' "$RESEARCH_MAP_DIR_ABS"/*.md 2>/dev/null && SECRETS_FOUND=true || SECRETS_FOUND=false

**If SECRETS_FOUND=true:**

```
>> SECURITY ALERT: Potential secrets detected in research map documents!

Found patterns that look like API keys or tokens in:
[show grep output]

This would expose credentials if committed.

**Action required:**
1. Review the flagged content above
2. If these are real secrets, they must be removed before committing
3. Consider adding sensitive files to your runtime's restricted-access list

Pausing before commit. Reply "safe to proceed" if the flagged content is not actually sensitive, or edit the files first.
```

Wait for user confirmation before continuing to commit_research_map.

**If SECRETS_FOUND=false:**

Continue to commit_research_map.

<step name="commit_research_map">
Commit the research map:

```bash

<step name="offer_next">
Present completion summary and next steps.

**Get line counts:**

```bash
wc -l "$RESEARCH_MAP_DIR_ABS"/*.md
