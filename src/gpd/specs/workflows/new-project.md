<stage_loading_rule>
The public command includes only `workflows/new-project/scope-intake.md`.
Later stages are loaded from the manifest-selected staged init payload. Use only
the active stage's `staged_loading.eager_authorities`. This root is only a
compatibility map and must not be used as executable workflow authority.
