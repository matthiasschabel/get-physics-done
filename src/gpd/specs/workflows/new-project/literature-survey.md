<purpose>
Own the optional full-mode literature survey after `GPD/PROJECT.md` exists and
before requirements authoring begins.
</purpose>

<stage_boundary>
This stage is post-approval and post-project-artifact only. It must not perform
scope intake, scope approval, workflow preference setup, requirements writing,
roadmapping, conventions setup, or completion cleanup. If approved scope,
`GPD/PROJECT.md`, or the staged init fields are missing, stop and reload the
correct earlier stage.
</stage_boundary>

<stage_init>
Run a fresh stage init before survey decisions or handoffs:

```bash
LITERATURE_SURVEY_INIT=$(gpd --raw init new-project --stage literature_survey)
if [ $? -ne 0 ]; then
  echo "ERROR: literature survey init failed: $LITERATURE_SURVEY_INIT"
  exit 1
fi
```

Use `gpd --raw stage field-access new-project --stage literature_survey --style instruction`
to confirm the manifest-selected fields. Read only those keys from
`LITERATURE_SURVEY_INIT`; `LITERATURE_SURVEY_INIT.staged_loading.required_init_fields`
is the runtime confirmation.

Use the staged `research_mode` from `LITERATURE_SURVEY_INIT` for all scout
handoffs. Do not reread config inside scouts.
</stage_init>

## 6. Literature Survey Decision

If auto mode is active, default to "Survey first" without asking.

Otherwise ask:

- header: "Literature Survey"
- question: "Survey the research landscape before defining the investigation plan?"
- options:
  - "Survey first (Recommended)" - Discover known results, standard methods, open problems, available data
  - "Skip survey" - I know this field well; go straight to planning

If the user skips the survey, checkpoint the explicit skip and continue to
`requirements_authoring`.

If "Survey first", display a survey banner, create `GPD/literature`, determine
whether `GPD/PROJECT.md` is a fresh project or continuation, and spawn the four
scouts below in parallel.

```bash
mkdir -p GPD/literature
SCOUT_HANDOFF_STARTED_AT=$(date -u +"%Y-%m-%dT%H:%M:%SZ")
```

@{GPD_INSTALL_DIR}/references/orchestration/runtime-delegation-note.md

**Scout child gate:**

  return_profile: "researcher"
  required_status: "completed"
  expected_artifacts:
    - "GPD/literature/PRIOR-WORK.md"
    - "GPD/literature/METHODS.md"
    - "GPD/literature/COMPUTATIONAL.md"
    - "GPD/literature/PITFALLS.md"

    - "readable artifact check for GPD/literature/{FILE}"
  applicator: none
  failure_route: "retry missing scout once | repair prompt once | stop this scout path | repair path once | fail closed | stop survey path | ..."
```

Route non-completed returns through
`references/orchestration/child-artifact-gate.md` and
`references/orchestration/continuation-boundary.md`: `checkpoint` -> fresh
continuation, `blocked` -> surface blocker and stop this scout path, `failed`
-> retry once then stop. Do not proceed with a partial literature survey,
synthesize from incomplete scout output, or silently downgrade to manual
main-context research.

After all 4 scout artifacts pass the gate, spawn synthesizer to create
`GPD/literature/SUMMARY.md`:

```bash
SYNTHESIZER_HANDOFF_STARTED_AT=$(date -u +"%Y-%m-%dT%H:%M:%SZ")
```

  applicator: none
  failure_route: "retry once | repair prompt once | stop synth path | retry once for fresh SUMMARY.md proof | repair path once | fail closed | ..."
```

Run the synthesizer gate before displaying or committing `SUMMARY.md`. Route
`checkpoint` through `references/orchestration/continuation-boundary.md`,
`blocked` -> surface blocker and stop synth path until resolved, `failed` ->
retry once then stop. If scout output is
incomplete, stop before the synthesizer. If the synthesizer gate remains
incomplete after retry, surface the blocker rather than creating a fallback
summary in the main context.

Display a concise literature-survey-complete banner and summarize key findings
from `GPD/literature/SUMMARY.md`.

**Commit research files:** pre-check the four scout files and `SUMMARY.md`, then
commit them with message `docs: literature survey complete` when commit policy
allows it.

**Checkpoint step 6:** update `GPD/init-progress.json` to step `6` with the
current UTC timestamp and description `Literature survey completed`.
