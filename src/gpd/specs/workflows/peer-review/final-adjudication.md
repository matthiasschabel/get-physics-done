<purpose>
Own Stage 6 final adjudication, referee report writing, review-ledger and
referee-decision validation, and upstream read-only enforcement.
</purpose>

<stage_boundary>
Stage 6 reads prior stage artifacts and spot-checks the manuscript. It may write
only Stage 6-owned adjudication artifacts for this round and must never modify or
list upstream staged-review artifacts in `gpd_return.files_written`.

The manifest loads the compact panel contract, Stage 6 boundary,
stage-recovery gate, review-ledger schema, and referee-decision schema. Use those
authorities for read-only upstream policy, retry classification, same-round proof
clearance, and final artifact validation.
</stage_boundary>

<final_adjudication>
Load staged final-adjudication before spawning `gpd-referee`:

```bash
FINAL_ADJUDICATION_INIT=$(gpd --raw init peer-review "$REVIEW_TARGET" --stage final_adjudication)
if [ $? -ne 0 ]; then
  echo "ERROR: gpd peer-review final-adjudication init failed: $FINAL_ADJUDICATION_INIT"
  # STOP; surface the error.
fi
```

Spawn `gpd-referee` over persisted artifacts only. It must read selected
manuscript path/hash, `${REVIEW_ROOT}/CLAIMS{round_suffix}.json`, all
`${REVIEW_ROOT}/STAGE-*{round_suffix}.json`, proof-redteam artifact when active,
and target-aware `latest_referee_report_md` / `latest_author_response` when this
is a revision round.

Stage 6 writes:

- `${PUBLICATION_ROOT}/REFEREE-REPORT{round_suffix}.md`
- `${PUBLICATION_ROOT}/REFEREE-REPORT{round_suffix}.tex`
- `${REVIEW_ROOT}/REVIEW-LEDGER{round_suffix}.json`
- `${REVIEW_ROOT}/REFEREE-DECISION{round_suffix}.json`
- `${PUBLICATION_ROOT}/CONSISTENCY-REPORT.md` when supported as a diagnostic sidecar

Stage 6 child gate:

```yaml
child_gate:
  id: "peer_review_stage6_referee"
  role: "gpd-referee"
  required_status: "completed"
  expected_artifacts:
    - "${PUBLICATION_ROOT}/REFEREE-REPORT{round_suffix}.md"
    - "${PUBLICATION_ROOT}/REFEREE-REPORT{round_suffix}.tex"
    - "${REVIEW_ROOT}/REVIEW-LEDGER{round_suffix}.json"
    - "${REVIEW_ROOT}/REFEREE-DECISION{round_suffix}.json"
    - "${PUBLICATION_ROOT}/CONSISTENCY-REPORT.md when produced"
  validators:
    - "gpd validate review-ledger ${REVIEW_ROOT}/REVIEW-LEDGER{round_suffix}.json"
    - "gpd validate referee-decision ${REVIEW_ROOT}/REFEREE-DECISION{round_suffix}.json --strict --ledger ${REVIEW_ROOT}/REVIEW-LEDGER{round_suffix}.json"
  failure_route: "stage-recovery-gate -> retry Stage 6-owned artifacts | fail back upstream"
```

Return through `peer_review_stage6_referee`. Do not trust the referee's success text until that typed return, the on-disk files, and the validators all agree.
</final_adjudication>

<adjudication_rules>
If any required staged-review artifact is missing, malformed, or uses the wrong
round suffix, STOP before final recommendation and fail back to the earliest
failing upstream stage. Do not repair upstream stage artifacts inside final
adjudication.

For proof-bearing claims, a missing, malformed, wrong-round, wrong-root, or
non-passing same-round `${REVIEW_ROOT}/PROOF-REDTEAM{round_suffix}.md` artifact
blocks any favorable recommendation. Recommendation floor: `major_revision` or
`reject`. A passing math stage with aligned `proof_audits[]` is necessary review
evidence but not a substitute for same-round proof-redteam clearance plus strict
referee-decision validation.

Use `publication-final-adjudication-boundary.md` for upstream read-only input
policy, strict decision validation, same-round proof-redteam clearance, and fresh
`gpd_return.files_written` enforcement. Locally keep `manuscript_path` non-empty
and identical across ledger, decision, and staged-review artifacts for this
round; set every strict `REFEREE-DECISION{round_suffix}.json` policy field.

Writable scope is limited to Stage 6-owned report `.md`/`.tex`, ledger,
decision, and optional consistency report. Do not modify
`${REVIEW_ROOT}/CLAIMS{round_suffix}.json`, any `${REVIEW_ROOT}/STAGE-*.json`,
or `${REVIEW_ROOT}/PROOF-REDTEAM{round_suffix}.md`. If those upstream artifacts
are missing, malformed, stale, or inconsistent, return `gpd_return.status:
blocked` and hand failure back instead of repairing it inside Stage 6.

`gpd_return.files_written` stays within the Stage 6 write allowlist; any upstream
path is a failed handoff.
</adjudication_rules>

<stage_recovery_6>
Require both JSON artifacts and both referee report files:

```bash
gpd validate review-ledger ${REVIEW_ROOT}/REVIEW-LEDGER{round_suffix}.json
gpd validate referee-decision ${REVIEW_ROOT}/REFEREE-DECISION{round_suffix}.json --strict --ledger ${REVIEW_ROOT}/REVIEW-LEDGER{round_suffix}.json
```

For proof-bearing reviews, this strict final-decision validator is the favorable
decision guardrail. Do not treat `gpd validate review-stage-report
${REVIEW_ROOT}/STAGE-math{round_suffix}.json`, even with aligned
`proof_audits[]`, as clearance without same-round
`${REVIEW_ROOT}/PROOF-REDTEAM{round_suffix}.md` plus strict decision validation.

Apply the `peer_review_stage6_referee` tuple and publication stage-recovery gate
before classifying outcome as recovery-eligible, upstream-blocked, or complete.
Only retry Stage 6 for Stage 6-owned artifact failures. If errors point at
`CLAIMS{round_suffix}.json`, `STAGE-*.json`, or
`PROOF-REDTEAM{round_suffix}.md`, STOP fail-closed and rerun the earliest failing
upstream stage. If the eligible Stage 6 retry also fails, do not proceed.

Upstream fail-back table:
- `CLAIMS{round_suffix}.json` or `STAGE-reader{round_suffix}.json` -> rerun Stage 1
- `STAGE-literature{round_suffix}.json` -> rerun Stage 2
- `STAGE-math{round_suffix}.json` or `PROOF-REDTEAM{round_suffix}.md` -> rerun Stage 3 and proof critique when applicable
- `STAGE-physics{round_suffix}.json` -> rerun Stage 4
- `STAGE-interestingness{round_suffix}.json` -> rerun Stage 5

Treat blank `manuscript_path` values in either
`${REVIEW_ROOT}/REVIEW-LEDGER{round_suffix}.json` or
`${REVIEW_ROOT}/REFEREE-DECISION{round_suffix}.json` as validation failures, not
optional bookkeeping.
</stage_recovery_6>

<handoff>
When Stage 6 validates, reload before final summary and routing:

```bash
FINALIZE_INIT=$(gpd --raw init peer-review "$REVIEW_TARGET" --stage finalize)
if [ $? -ne 0 ]; then
  echo "ERROR: gpd peer-review finalize init failed: $FINALIZE_INIT"
  # STOP; surface the error.
fi
```
</handoff>
