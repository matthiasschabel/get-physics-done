<purpose>
Own Stage 1 claim extraction, Stages 2-5 specialist review, conditional
same-round proof-redteam review, and stage-artifact validation.
</purpose>

<stage_boundary>
Panel stages start only after bootstrap, preflight, and artifact discovery have
resolved target and round state. Each stage runs in a fresh subagent context and
writes a compact artifact. Apply
`{GPD_INSTALL_DIR}/references/publication/stage-recovery-gate.md` for spawned
reviewer/proof-auditor/referee lifecycle, checkpoint continuation, stale-output
rejection, retry freshness, and sequential fallback cleanup.

The manifest loads `references/publication/peer-review-panel.md` for the machine
contract and `references/publication/peer-review-panel-playbook.md` for Stage 1-5
reviewer guidance. Bundle guidance enters as handles only:
`selected_protocol_bundle_ids` and `protocol_bundle_load_manifest`.
Reader-visible claims, surfaced evidence, `${MANUSCRIPT_ROOT}/FIGURE_TRACKER.md`,
`GPD/comparisons/*-COMPARISON.md`, and review-support artifacts are first-class.
Read reference files by handle only when targeted evidence is needed; do not
hydrate broad rendered reference or protocol bodies into panel init.
</stage_boundary>

<announce_panel>
Load the staged panel payload before launching Stage 1 through Stage 5 and the
conditional proof audit:

```bash
PANEL_INIT=$(gpd --raw init peer-review "$REVIEW_TARGET" --stage panel_stages)
if [ $? -ne 0 ]; then
  echo "ERROR: gpd peer-review panel init failed: $PANEL_INIT"
  # STOP; surface the error.
fi
```

Before spawning any reviewer, announce the review with this concise stage map:

`Launching the six-stage review panel: Stage 1 maps the paper's claims; Stages 2-3 check prior work and mathematical soundness in parallel; theorem-style claims also trigger the auxiliary gpd-check-proof audit; Stage 4 checks whether the physical interpretation is supported; Stage 5 judges significance and venue fit; Stage 6 synthesizes everything into the final recommendation.`
</announce_panel>

<child_return_contract>
Use these callsite-owned tuples. Stage identity comes from tuple role, expected
paths, write allowlist, canonical filenames, and validators; never trust a stage
label inside `gpd_return`.

```yaml
peer_review_stage1_reader:
  role: gpd-review-reader
  expected_artifacts: ["${REVIEW_ROOT}/CLAIMS{round_suffix}.json", "${REVIEW_ROOT}/STAGE-reader{round_suffix}.json"]

```
</child_return_contract>

<stage_1_claim_extraction>
Stage 1 reads the whole manuscript once and writes
`${REVIEW_ROOT}/CLAIMS{round_suffix}.json` and
`${REVIEW_ROOT}/STAGE-reader{round_suffix}.json`. Spawn
`gpd-review-reader` with selected manuscript path/hash, journal when known,
round number/suffix, `PUBLICATION_ROOT`, and `REVIEW_ROOT`. The reader must
preserve exact `manuscript_path`, `manuscript_sha256`, claim ids,
theorem-like claim kind, theorem assumptions, and theorem parameters.

```bash
gpd validate review-claim-index ${REVIEW_ROOT}/CLAIMS{round_suffix}.json
gpd validate review-stage-report ${REVIEW_ROOT}/STAGE-reader{round_suffix}.json
```

If Stage 1 fails, apply stage-recovery gate and retry once with the
`StageReviewReport` / `ClaimIndex` schema reminder. If validation still fails,
STOP before Stages 2-6.
</stage_1_claim_extraction>

<stage_2_3_and_proof_redteam>
Stage 2 literature reads manuscript, claims, reader stage, bibliography audit,
bib files, comparisons, figure tracker, and targeted web search only when
novelty/positioning is uncertain. It writes
`${REVIEW_ROOT}/STAGE-literature{round_suffix}.json`.

Stage 3 math reads manuscript, claims, reader stage, summaries, verification,
artifact/reproducibility manifests, and proof artifacts when present. It writes
`${REVIEW_ROOT}/STAGE-math{round_suffix}.json`. Require exactly one
`proof_audits[]` entry per reviewed theorem-bearing claim, with each
`proof_audits[].claim_id` also in `claims_reviewed`.

When theorem-bearing claims are present, run `gpd-check-proof` as the auxiliary
proof critique, writing `${REVIEW_ROOT}/PROOF-REDTEAM{round_suffix}.md`. The
manifest-loaded proof-redteam workflow gate, protocol, and schema authorities
own same-round theorem binding, frontmatter, status handling, and validation.

Conditional proof prompt:

```text
First, read {GPD_AGENTS_DIR}/gpd-check-proof.md for your role and instructions.
Then read {GPD_INSTALL_DIR}/templates/proof-redteam-schema.md and {GPD_INSTALL_DIR}/references/verification/core/proof-redteam-protocol.md before writing any proof audit artifact.

Operate in adversarial proof-critique mode with a fresh context.
Follow the proof-redteam protocol's one-shot return semantics.
Write to: `${REVIEW_ROOT}/PROOF-REDTEAM{round_suffix}.md`
```

The proof-redteam task and artifact must copy active `manuscript_path`,
`manuscript_sha256`, round, theorem-bearing `claim_ids`, and
`proof_artifact_paths` from `${REVIEW_ROOT}/CLAIMS{round_suffix}.json`; include
the manuscript entrypoint when it is not already listed. Missing, malformed,
wrong-round/root, `status: gaps_found`, or `status: human_needed` proof artifacts
block favorable recommendation. Retry proof-redteam once, then STOP if invalid.

Run Stage 2, Stage 3, and proof critique in parallel when the runtime supports
it; otherwise run literature, math, proof. Treat them as one barriered wave:

```bash
gpd validate review-stage-report ${REVIEW_ROOT}/STAGE-literature{round_suffix}.json
gpd validate review-stage-report ${REVIEW_ROOT}/STAGE-math{round_suffix}.json
```

If proof-bearing review is active, also validate same-round
`${REVIEW_ROOT}/PROOF-REDTEAM{round_suffix}.md`. Before Stage 4, every launched
child must have a typed return, every promised artifact must exist and validate,
and downstream work restarts only from persisted artifacts plus declared
carry-forward inputs.
</stage_2_3_and_proof_redteam>

<stage_4_physics>
Stage 4 checks physical soundness after math. It reads manuscript, reader, math,
literature, proof-redteam artifact if active, summaries, verifications,
comparisons, and figure tracker. It writes
`${REVIEW_ROOT}/STAGE-physics{round_suffix}.json`.

```bash
gpd validate review-stage-report ${REVIEW_ROOT}/STAGE-physics{round_suffix}.json
```

Apply stage-recovery gate. Retry once from the same persisted inputs; if still
invalid, STOP before Stage 5.
</stage_4_physics>

<stage_5_significance>
Stage 5 judges interestingness and venue fit after technical stages. It reads
manuscript, reader, literature, physics, proof-redteam artifact if active, and
target journal. It writes `${REVIEW_ROOT}/STAGE-interestingness{round_suffix}.json`.

```bash
gpd validate review-stage-report ${REVIEW_ROOT}/STAGE-interestingness{round_suffix}.json
```

After validation, Stage 6 must begin from persisted stage artifacts and declared
carry-forward inputs only.
</stage_5_significance>

<handoff>
Reload before final adjudication:

```bash
FINAL_ADJUDICATION_INIT=$(gpd --raw init peer-review "$REVIEW_TARGET" --stage final_adjudication)
if [ $? -ne 0 ]; then
  echo "ERROR: gpd peer-review final-adjudication init failed: $FINAL_ADJUDICATION_INIT"
  # STOP; surface the error.
fi
```
</handoff>
