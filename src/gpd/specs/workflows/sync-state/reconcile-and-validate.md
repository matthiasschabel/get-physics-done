<purpose>
Apply the selected repair path, validate the state pair, report the result, and keep commit optional.
</purpose>

<process>

<step name="reconcile">
Load reconcile/validate immediately before writing either state file:

```bash
RECONCILE_INIT=$(gpd --raw init sync-state --stage reconcile_and_validate)
if [ $? -ne 0 ]; then
  echo "ERROR: gpd sync-state reconcile init failed: $RECONCILE_INIT"
  exit 1
fi
```

Use `reconcile_and_validate.required_init_fields` as the reconciliation inputs.
These are compact existence, recovery, and loader-status fields. Do not request
or inspect raw state file bodies in this stage; the backend repair command owns
the source decision and all state mutation.

Run the backend reconciliation command. It chooses the recovery source from the
loader result, prefers valid backup state over malformed markdown, rejects
malformed markdown-only recovery, preserves JSON-only fields, and writes the
dual state pair atomically.

```bash
SYNC_STATE_REPAIR=$(gpd --raw --cwd "$PROJECT_ROOT" state repair-sync)
if [ $? -ne 0 ]; then
  echo "ERROR: gpd sync-state repair failed: $SYNC_STATE_REPAIR"
  exit 1
fi
```

**Verify sync result:**

```bash
gpd --raw --cwd "$PROJECT_ROOT" state validate
```

If validation fails, report the validation issues and stop. Do not commit a partially reconciled pair.
If schema-specific failure context is needed after backend validation fails,
select the `backend_validation_failed_needs_schema_context` conditional
authority for diagnosis only. Do not patch `GPD/STATE.md`, `GPD/state.json`, or
`GPD/state.json.bak` by hand.
</step>

<step name="report">
**Report what happened:**

```
━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━
 GPD > STATE SYNCHRONIZED
━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━

**Source used:** {state.json | STATE.md recovery}
**Structured fields authoritative:** state.json
**Markdown projection:** regenerated from the authoritative source
**Validation status:** {healthy / warning / degraded}

If they diverged, report changed mirrored fields and note JSON-only fields were preserved.
```
</step>

<step name="optional_commit">
**Only if the operator explicitly asks to commit the reconciled state:**

```bash
PRE_CHECK=$(gpd --cwd "$PROJECT_ROOT" pre-commit-check --files GPD/STATE.md GPD/state.json 2>&1) || true
echo "$PRE_CHECK"

gpd --cwd "$PROJECT_ROOT" commit \
  "fix: reconcile STATE.md and state.json divergence" \
  --files GPD/STATE.md GPD/state.json
```
</step>

</process>

<failure_handling>

- **STATE.md corrupt:** The backend repair path regenerates markdown from valid structured state. If primary JSON is missing or corrupt, it prefers a valid `state.json.bak` before considering markdown. Malformed markdown-only recovery fails closed.
- **state.json corrupt (invalid JSON):** The backend repair path uses the recovery-aware state loader and valid backup when available; if backup is also unusable, use the fail-closed bad-backup branch.
- **Both files exist but disagree:** Treat the mismatch as a reportable drift, not a bidirectional merge request. Use `state.json` for structured fields and regenerate `STATE.md` from it unless `state.json` is unreadable.
- **Regeneration fails validation:** Stop and report the blocking issues. Do not stage or commit the pair.

- [ ] Validation rerun after regeneration
- [ ] Divergences reported without ad hoc merge heuristics
